# **US 2020 Covid-19 Rates and Cases Maps**

## Introduction
For GEOG 458 Lab 3, I was tasked with creating two maps that displayed the United States Covid-19 rates and cases in each county during 2020. As a result, this project is named, *US 2020 Covid-19 Rates and Cases Maps*.

The first map I created is titled, **[US 2020 Covid-19 Rates](https://katelynsaechao.github.io/US-2020-Covid-19-Rates-and-Cases-Maps/map1.html)**. It is a choropleth map that has a sequential color scheme, in which darker colors indicate higher Covid-19 rates in that given county. The interactive component of this map is activated by hovering over a county. When hovering over a county, the viewer is able to learn information such as the county and state they are hovering over, as well as the Covid-19 rate.

The second map I created is titled, **[US 2020 Covid-19 Cases](https://katelynsaechao.github.io/US-2020-Covid-19-Rates-and-Cases-Maps/map2.html)**. It is a proportional symbol map that has a sequential color scheme. Smaller and lighter dots indicate a lower number of Covid-19 cases, whereas darker and bigger dots indicate a higher number of Covid-19 cases within a given county. The interactive component of this map is activated by clicking on a dot. When clicking a dot, the viewer is able to learn information about the county and state they clicked on, as well as the number of Covid-19 cases.
